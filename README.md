## Hi 👋 This is Pawin Prasertsakul ![](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=catptype)

- 🔭 I build practical AI solutions from concept to deployment, often as **full-stack web applications**. I'm **currently seeking my next role** where I can tackle fun and challenging projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various tools for **full-stack web development**.
- 💬 Ask me about **computer vision**, **Python**, or **Django**.
- ⚡ **Fun Facts**:
    - I play so many Japanese video games (like **Dream Club**) that I learned to read and speak Japanese! 🎮🇯🇵
    - Gacha games are so salty, but I keep drawing for more! 🎲💔
    - I wrote a Python script to automatically organize all my files—it saved my sanity. 🐍📂
